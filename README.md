**Disclaimer:**
This code was created on data in Netilion containing at least 1 asset in "failure*" status. The Asset also links to an AssetHealthCondition object that has both a cause and a remedy object associated. If these conditions are not met, this code will not yield the expected results. The code merely acts as a example to teach how data from the Netilion API can be requested, parsed, and integrated into 3rd party applications (Dialogflow, Google Assistant, Telegram). The code can act as a basis to customize & improve the code to suit your respective needs.
